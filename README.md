# CSharpChallenges
It's a repository focused on solving programming challenges with C#.

## List of Challenges
- ## String Manipulation:
  - Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
  - Write a function that reverses a string without using built-in functions.
  - Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of each character in a string.
  - Write a function that removes all duplicate characters from a string.
  - Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
- ## Arrays and Collections:
  - Write a function that finds the smallest and largest element in an array.
  - Write a function that sorts an array in ascending order using selection sort or bubble sort.
  - Write a function that removes all duplicate elements from an array.
  - Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
  - Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in different order).
- ## Classes and Objects:
  - Create a class to represent a bank account with properties for balance, account number, and owner name. Implement methods to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds.
  - Create a class to represent a shape with properties for color and area. Implement subclasses for circle, square, and triangle, each with their own way of calculating area.
  - Create a class to represent a car with properties for model, year, and mileage. Implement methods to start, stop, and accelerate the car.
  - Create a class to represent a deck of cards and another class to represent a hand of cards. Implement methods to shuffle the deck, deal cards, and check for winning hands.
  - Create a class to represent a student with properties for name, student ID, and grades. Implement methods to calculate the average grade and check if the student is passing or failing.
- ## File I/O:
  - Write a program that reads data from a text file and writes it to another text file, reversing the order of the lines.
  - Write a program that reads data from a CSV file and prints it to the console.
  - Write a program that writes a list of names to a binary file and then reads them back from the file.
  - Write a program that reads log files and calculates the number of times a specific error message occurs.
  - Write a program that reads a file and replaces all occurrences of a specific word with another word.
- ## Advanced Concepts:
  - Implement a simple calculator using a switch statement and loops.
  - Create a custom exception class and throw it when invalid data is entered.
  - Implement a simple database using a dictionary or another data structure.
  - Create a simple web application using ASP.NET Core MVC or another framework.
  - Implement a simple game using a graphics library like MonoGame or SFML.
